    /**
     * @brief Component storage class keeping its data in constant size segments
     * 
     * @tparam C type of component
     * 
     * @details
     * Can store components in a series of contiguous segments. Segments between each other are not necesairly contiguous.
     * Memory for these segments never has to be moved. It only needs to be allocated and deallocated (during storage's 
     * lifetime this is optional).
     * 
     * Segmenting the storage allows for relative balance between speed and being able to access data using pointers.
     * The problem with using simple vector for this comes with that last part. Let's take simple situation:
     * at the beginning of the tick user decides to cache some component pointer. During the tick user creates a lot
     * of components. If the amount of these new ones exceeds the capacity of the vector the memory has to be reallocated
     * for bigger size. This can invalidate the pointer we talked about. This does not need to happen accross the whole tick.
     * You can simply have a situation where one thread is caching component and the other is creating them.
     * I decided to do it this way and focus on making sure that important objects like component batches will have their contents modified 
     * whenever component creation/eraseure happens. Using indices would be safer, but would require more preperation.
     * 
     * Using direct pointers is also more user friendly and transparent when it comes to code outside of systems, like scripts in my opinion. 
     * The only thing to remember is that user is not the *direct* owner of components themselves, so it's safer to repeat fetching components
     * (and checking if they're valid) from these places on every tick rather than clinging onto them for an unspecified amount of time. 
     * 
     * User does not need to care how the data is stored - all he/she cares about is that no weird stuff will happen to pointers they cached during a tick
     * if they decide to create some components and forget to explicitly preallocate more memory before that.
     * In practice this allows for safely caching pointers not just for the duration of a tick, but for the entire lifetime 
     * of the component.
     * 
     * The segment size set for the storage depends solely on how frequently and in which quantity components of given type have to be created.
     * You can even specify a very large segment size in the constructor and allocate memory for components only once, and if this amount
     * happens to run out anyways, nothing too bad will happen anyways.
     * When specifying segment size strike a balance between how big it will be and in which quantities will be created. It general it's best
     * to keep the number of segments that will have to be created to minimum, but at the same time think not to make these too big to be able
     * to load them from memory more easily.
     * 
     * This class works a bit similair to how std::deque is implemented, but here we can specify the size of allocated arrays.
